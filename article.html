                    </header>
                    <p>This guide assumes that you already have an AWS account and an IAM user. If you don't have them, please, follow <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/signup-create-iam-user.html">these instructions</a>.</p>
                    <p>Since we are going to use Java for our Lambda service you also have to install <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html">Java SDK</a> on your machine,
                        <s>thanks cap</s>. Note that AWS Lambda supports Java 8.</p>

                        <h3>Tools</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>First thing we want to do is to create a Java project. There are two things to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To communicate with AWS SES our Lambda service will use AWS SDK which means that we have to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-install.html#include-sdk">include it in our project</a> as a dependecny.</li>
                        <li>Later on we will have to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-java-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">create a deployment package</a> of our Java project and upload it to AWS Lambda.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are several ways to achieve that, but we will use <a href="https://maven.apache.org/index.html">Maven</a> as a build automation tool to add required dependencies to our Java project and to build a JAR file for the deployment.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <div class="section-divider">
                        <hr class="section-divider">
                    </div>
                    <header>
                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Now let's make our hands dirty and write some code.</p>
                    <p>This is how <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">Maven directory layout</a> for our project will look like:</p>
                    <pre>
lambda-ses
| 
|-- pom.xml
|  
|-- src
|   |
|   '-- main
|       |
|       '-- java
|           |
|           '-- ...</pre>
                    <p>To keep it clear we will define a simple <i>pom.xml</i> template first:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/1a16a3de7a6632396bafafb12f5a4fbc.js"></script>
                    <p>Then we will insert only those dependencies which are required by our Lambda service to function and succesfully communicate with AWS SES:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/40b0188d7c1928f97ed26db6980c3a1d.js"></script>
                    <p>Since Lambda <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/create-deployment-pkg-zip-java.html">requires us to deploy standalone JARs</a> - we have to use <a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/">Maven Shade plugin</a>, which will put binary files of all our dependencies into <i>/lib</i> directory of the JAR file which we will generate later:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/8606892da5cf2ed1da6d43095bd6ff2b.js"></script>
                    <p>Now we will create a simple Java class which will use AWS SDK to send emails over HTTP to SES:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/672bd93f01bd187a7567148bc6e350aa.js"></script>
                    <details>
                        <summary>MORE DETAILS</summary>
                        <p>Connection's timeout for AWS SES is 3 seconds — this way we will get an exception if there is a problem related to establishing the connection before our Lambda service will be interrupted (the execution timeout for the service will be defined later during its creation).</p>
                        <p>Request's timeout for AWS SES is 3 seconds, but according to AWS SDK source code — there is no guarantee that we will get timeout's exception precicely in 3 seonds (technical details). However the difference between our service's execution timeout and request's timeout should be enough to get an exception if there is a problem related to processing a request before the service will be interrupted.</p>
                        <p>There is no need to define socket's timeout since request's timeout will cover socket related delays.</p>
                        <p>Also we don't define retries' limit since retries won’t be triggered if request's timeout is defined. If the first request fails — we immideately will get an exception.</p>
                        <p>Client's configuration also allows us to define execution's timeout, which will cover establishing a connection and processing a request. The timeout is disabled by default and we want to keep it that way to get more specific information about any problem we may get.</p>
                        <p>Client's builder allows us to specify AWS credentials which will be used to athorise our HTTP request. But we don’t need to specify the credentials, since whenever we run our Lambda service it will automatically use credentials of a role assigned to the service during its creation (we will do it later). However the credentials might be useful if you want to send the requests using some other user or role:</p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/a4d4cc7ffff67f7bd71fe4c6a3fd4210.js"></script>
                    </details>
                    <p>And the last step is to create a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/programming-model-v2.html">Lambda service's handler</a>, which will be called when our service is invoked. The handler function has to be public and located in a public Java class:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/316eab098d745fbaa0722725451cffe2.js"></script>
                    <details>
                        <summary>MORE DETAILS</summary>
                        <p>We use environment variables to specify recepient (TO) and sender (FROM) email addresses for convience to avoid updating source code while testing our function.</p>
                    </details>
                    <p>As you can see we are using our own exception for the email service, to keep AWS SES SDK related classes away from the Lambda handler's level:</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/GogaRUFI/9414c3652bd602aab30d529d64723fee.js"></script>

                    <p>Thanks to Maven Shade plugin - we can create a standalon JAR file by simply calling: </p>

                    <p>Now we have a JAR file to run, but still don't have an environment to do it in. For that we have to create and configure our AWS Lambda service. To create one we will use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS Management Console</a>. For that you have to login to your AWS account and go to AWS Lambda page. If you prefer to use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS CLI</a> instead you can find instructions <a href="#cli">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>We don't specify policies to demostrate later which of them are actually required for our Lambda service to be able to use SES.</p>
                    </details>
                    <p>Define available memory and execution timeout.</p>
                    <figure><img src="img/memory_timeout.png"></figure>

                        <p>Average max memory used by the function to send one email will be about 60 MB (you will see it in "Summury" section of your Lambda service's page after its execution is finnished). But in practice 192 MB turned out to be the most reliable amount of memory. We can also set 128 MB, but in this case we may occasionally get OutOfMemoryError. It happens mostly when a virtual <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html">container</a> for our function doesn't exist yet or has to be recreated. Probably the creation process of the virtual container somehow affects the service's memory abvailability and JVM simply can't cleanup or reserve required space in time:</p>
                        <pre>Can’t send the email due to an exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</pre>
                        <p>If the container still exists after the last invokation of our service - then 128 MB should be enough to successfully complete its execution.</p>
                        <p>The timeout also depends on our service's life cycle. When a virtual container of the lambda function already exists — average execution time will be around 900 ms, but if the container has to be created — the execution time will be around 19 seconds.</p>
                        <p>Therefore 20 seconds is the most reliable value in this case.</p>
                        <p>If the timeout value is too small, the function will be interrupted before it finishes its task:</p>
                        <pre>{<br>   “errorMessage”: “xxx xxx Task timed out after 5.00 seconds”<br>}</pre>
                        <p>AWS Lambda manages <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction-function.html#resource-model">compute resources</a> according to the available amoumt of memory, which means that you can reduce the execution time by simply rising the limit of memory.</p>

                        <p>The default VPC <em>automatically manages our lambda service's access to the public network</em> where AWS SES is located, which means that we don't have to do any extra work as if we were using our own VPC.</p>

                        <p>As you can see this policy allows only sending email messages through AWS SES. This is minimum actions required for our Lambda service.</p>
                    </details>
                    <p>Then we have to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-using.html#attach-managed-policy-console">attach the policy</a> to <i>lambda-email-sender</i> role which is used by our service.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Once the policy is attached we can successfully run the service. Check your recepient's mailbox to make sure that you got the message.</p>
